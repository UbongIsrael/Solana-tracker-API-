Simple Scripts showing token and wallet details on Solana.
The Scripts make use of solanatracker.io APIs so an account will be needed. You can sign up for a free API key.

Just simple modular codes that can help while you build your project or bot that request price and token data

Head to https://www.solanatracker.io/?ref=NFDDZF5R (includes my ref code) then subscribe to an API package under accounts
once you've created your account. For more information on their DOCS you can visit [their documentation](https://docs.solanatracker.io/public-data-api/docs)


Input your API key in Config.py

Run 'main.py' to test the calls.
